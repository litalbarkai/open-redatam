# Open Redatam 1.0

Mostly changes requested by CRAN about how to handle the data and the dictionaries.

# Open Redatam 0.2

* Refactored to use C++11 and pugixml instead of C++17 and Apache Xerces. This simplifies the build process.
* Corrects and issue with the inconsistent use of uppercase and lowercase with some dictionaries (e.g., Bolivian Census 2001).

# Open Redatam 0.1

* First release of the open-redatam project.
* It works with most of the REDATAM databases we found in the web.
