* This is a new release.
* Re-sending as I realized the C++11 refactoring was more easy to do than I
  thought. This removes the note "C++17 is not supported in all platforms" from
  the previous submission.
* v0.2.1 adds the changes requested by Beni Altmann about \donttest and ctb/dtc
  in DESCRIPTION.
  
Submission note:

* I see there is a version 1.0 here https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/archive/
* Mine was 0.2.1, Jaime Salvador sent 1.0 but that's another project.
* Can I maintain the name? Mine was sent before Jaime's, and I added the CRAN requested changes with due anticipation. 
* On 2024-10-11 I received an email from CRAN saying "Submission cancelled as we received 1.0.0"
* I also see that Jaime's version is a binary package, mine is source.
