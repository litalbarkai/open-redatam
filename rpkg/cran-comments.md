* This is a new release.
* Re-sending as I realized the C++11 refactoring was more easy to do than I
  thought. This removes the note "C++17 is not supported in all platforms" from
  the previous submission.
* v0.2.1 adds the changes requested by Beni Altmann about \donttest and ctb/dtc
  in DESCRIPTION.
